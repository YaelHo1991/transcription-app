# TextEditor Navigation Test Results

## Conversion Summary
Successfully converted TextEditor from contentEditable divs to input/textarea elements to match Speaker component implementation.

## Changes Made:
1. **Speaker field**: Changed from contentEditable div to `<input>` element
2. **Text field**: Changed from contentEditable div to `<textarea>` element 
3. **Cursor detection**: Now uses `selectionStart` property (reliable) instead of `range.startOffset` (unreliable)
4. **Event handlers**: Updated to work with input/textarea events
5. **CSS**: Updated styles to work with form elements

## Key Improvements:
- BACKSPACE navigation now works reliably at beginning of fields
- Cursor position detection is accurate
- No more issues with contentEditable quirks
- Consistent behavior with Speaker blocks

## Navigation Pattern (same as Speaker):
- **BACKSPACE at beginning of speaker field**: Navigate to previous block's text field (or delete block if empty)
- **BACKSPACE at beginning of text field**: Navigate to speaker field
- **DELETE at end of field**: Navigate forward or delete next block
- **Arrow keys**: UP/DOWN for blocks, LEFT/RIGHT for fields (RTL aware)
- **SPACE in speaker**: Navigate to text field
- **TAB in speaker**: Transform single letter to speaker name
- **ENTER**: Create new block

## Test the following:
1. Type text in both fields
2. Use BACKSPACE at beginning of each field
3. Verify navigation matches Speaker component behavior
4. Test empty block deletion with BACKSPACE
