## Review Notes

The backup system implementation is complete with all 11 stages successfully implemented. The system provides comprehensive backup functionality with auto-save, version history, media management, and user feedback. The toolbar has been reorganized to handle the increased functionality while maintaining a clean, organized interface.

Key achievements:
- Automatic backups every 60 seconds
- Version history with preview and restore
- Media file association management
- Visual feedback for all operations
- Space-efficient toolbar with collapsible groups
- Full Hebrew text support

The system is ready for production integration once authentication is properly configured and DEV_MODE is disabled.
