# Todo List - TextEditor and Speaker Component Improvements

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Phase 1: Navigation and Input System Conversion
1. ✅ Convert TextEditor from contentEditable to input/textarea elements
   - Replaced contentEditable divs with input (speaker) and textarea (text) elements
   - Fixed cursor position detection using selectionStart property
   - Implemented auto-resize functionality for textareas

2. ✅ Implement consistent navigation patterns
   - BACKSPACE: Navigate to previous field/block when at beginning
   - DELETE: Navigate forward or delete next block when at end
   - Arrow keys: Smart navigation within and between blocks
   - HOME/END: Navigate within lines and between blocks
   - TAB/ENTER: Standard field and block navigation
   - SPACE: Transform speaker codes and navigate

3. ✅ Fix styling issues
   - Removed purple backgrounds
   - Added subtle green focus outlines
   - Proper RTL/LTR text direction support
   - Fixed colon positioning in center

### Phase 2: Speaker Component Enhancements
4. ✅ Allow multiple letters in speaker code field
   - Removed single character restriction
   - Codes can now be multi-character (e.g., "גכ", "ABC")

5. ✅ Add duplicate code validation
   - Validation only triggers on navigation, not while typing
   - Shows styled error messages in turquoise tooltip
   - Prevents navigation when duplicate detected

6. ✅ Prevent spaces in speaker codes
   - Space key triggers navigation instead of inserting space
   - All spaces are filtered out from code input

7. ✅ Transform speaker on all navigation keys
   - Not just SPACE, but also TAB, ENTER, arrows, HOME, END
   - Ensures speaker is always transformed before leaving field

### Phase 3: Speaker Creation and Display
8. ✅ Fix speaker creation to use first empty block
   - No longer creates new rows unnecessarily
   - Utilizes existing empty blocks first

9. ✅ Remove default active block on load
   - Speaker component starts with no active block
   - User must click to start editing

10. ✅ Remove automatic name duplication
    - Names start empty instead of copying code
    - TextEditor shows code when name is empty

11. ✅ Fix speaker name update propagation
    - Full names now update in TextEditor blocks
    - Tracks block-to-speaker associations
    - Multi-character names like "אברהים" display completely

## Review Summary

### Major Achievements
- Successfully converted TextEditor from unreliable contentEditable to standard form inputs
- Implemented comprehensive keyboard navigation matching user expectations
- Fixed React state synchronization issues between components
- Created robust speaker management system with proper validation
- Resolved all text direction (RTL/LTR) and display issues

### Technical Improvements
- Better separation of concerns between components
- Proper event handling and propagation
- Consistent navigation patterns across all components
- Smart cursor positioning and focus management
- Efficient state tracking with refs and hooks

### Key Files Modified
- `TextEditor/TextEditor.tsx` - Main editor with speaker tracking
- `TextEditor/blocks/TextBlock.tsx` - Converted to input/textarea
- `Speaker/SimpleSpeaker.tsx` - Enhanced speaker management
- `Speaker/blocks/SpeakerBlock.tsx` - Added validation and navigation
- Various CSS files for styling improvements

### Navigation Flow
The system now provides intuitive navigation:
- Natural flow between fields with TAB

- Smart BACKSPACE/DELETE behavior
- Automatic speaker transformation on all exits
- Proper HOME/END key support

The implementation is complete and working as requested.
