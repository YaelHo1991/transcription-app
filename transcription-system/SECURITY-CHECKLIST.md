# Security Checklist - Transcription System

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Measures

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
- [x] JWT-based authentication with secure secret keys
- [x] ABCDEF permission system for granular access control

- [x] Role-based access control (admin/user/transcriber)

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
- [x] Login attempts limited to 5 per 15 minutes
- [x] API requests limited to 100 per 15 minutes
- [x] Strict rate limiting for sensitive operations (10 per hour)

### 3. **Security Headers (Helmet)**
- [x] Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] HSTS with preload
- [x] XSS Protection
- [x] Referrer Policy: no-referrer

### 4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
- [x] SQL injection protection middleware
- [x] MongoDB injection protection (express-mongo-sanitize)
- [x] Request size limits (50MB max)
- [x] Pattern matching for suspicious SQL/Script patterns

### 5. **CORS Configuration**
- [x] Restricted origins in production
- [x] Credentials support with proper headers
- [x] Limited allowed methods and headers

### 6. **Environment Variables**
- [x] Separate .env files for development and production
- [x] JWT secrets properly configured
- [x] Database credentials secured
- [x] API keys managed through environment

### 7. **Development Tools Security**
- [x] Dev tools only accessible in development mode
- [x] Mock data only available in development
- [x] Production environment blocks /dev routes

### 8. **Code Organization**
- [x] Removed old PHP code directory
- [x] Cleaned up duplicate files
- [x] Organized folder structure
- [x] Removed hardcoded credentials

## üîí Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. [ ] Change all default passwords in `.env.production`
2. [ ] Generate new JWT secret (minimum 64 characters)
3. [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
4. [ ] Set `ENABLE_DEV_TOOLS=false`
5. [ ] Configure proper database SSL certificates
6. [ ] Update FRONTEND_URL to production domain
7. [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS certificates
8. [ ] Configure firewall rules
9. [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
10. [ ] Regular security audits with `npm audit`
11. [ ] Implement backup strategy
12. [ ] Configure DDoS protection (CloudFlare/AWS Shield)

## üö® Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit .env files to version control**
2. **Regularly update dependencies**
3. **Use HTTPS in production**
4. **Implement proper logging without exposing sensitive data**
5. **Regular security audits**
6. **Principle of least privilege for database users**
7. **Regular backups with encryption**
8. **Monitor for unusual activity**

## üìä Current Security Status

- **Request Size Limit**: 50MB (prevents DoS attacks)
- **Password Policy**: Bcrypt with proper salt rounds
- **Session Security**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
- **CSRF Protection**: Token validation on state-changing operations
- **API Security**: Key-based authentication for sensitive endpoints

## üîç Areas for Future Enhancement

1. Implement 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
2. Add audit logging for all sensitive operations
3. Implement IP whitelisting for admin access
4. Add automated security scanning in CI/CD
5. Implement data encryption at rest
6. Add rate limiting per user (not just per IP)
7. Implement proper CSRF tokens across all forms
8. Add WebAuthn/FIDO2 support for passwordless authentication
