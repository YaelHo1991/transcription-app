## Original Stages (Completed)

## Stage 1: Fix Layout Responsive Scaling
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Commit**: `8558795`  
**Objective**: Components maintain proportions on larger screens with increased spacing

### Changes:
- Wrap main content in a max-width container (e.g., 1600px)
- Center the container on larger screens
- Add padding that increases with screen size
- Components maintain fixed max-widths with flexible gaps

### Files:
- `transcription-page.css`
- `page.tsx` (wrapper divs)

### Expected Result:
- Components don't stretch on wide screens
- More whitespace between components on larger displays
- Consistent proportions across screen sizes

### Testing Checklist:
- [x] Components maintain proportions on 1920px+ screens
- [x] Spacing increases on larger screens
- [x] Layout remains centered
- [x] No horizontal scrolling

### Completion Notes:
- Successfully removed max-width constraint
- Gaps increase dramatically on larger screens (up to 70px)
- Header properly aligned with 15px top margin
- Scrollbars completely hidden using multiple techniques
- All components now scale properly with screen size

## Stage 2: Fix White Space at Bottom
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Fixed in Stage 1)  
**Objective**: Remove white gap at page bottom

### Changes:
- Adjust main-content height calculations
- Fix workspace-grid to fill available height
- Remove conflicting min/max height constraints

### Files:
- `transcription-page.css` (main-content, workspace sections)

### Expected Result:
- No white space at bottom of viewport
- Components fill available height properly

### Testing Checklist:
- [x] No white space at bottom in normal view
- [x] No white space when scrolling
- [x] Components don't overflow unnecessarily

## Stage 3: Fix TextEditor RTL Issues
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Commit**: `ea20c19`  
**Objective**: Fix Hebrew text direction and marks sidebar

### Changes:
- Re-enable marks sidebar with turquoise theme (140px width)
- Fix TextEditor layout to use column direction
- Move statistics to footer
- Apply dir="rtl" and unicode-bidi for proper Hebrew text
- Change contenteditable from span to div

### Files:
- `TextEditor.tsx`
- `TextEditor.css`
- `TextBlock.tsx`

### Expected Result:
- Hebrew text appears correctly right-aligned
- Cursor positioning works properly
- Marks sidebar visible and functional

### Testing Checklist:
- [x] Hebrew text displays RTL
- [x] Cursor appears in correct position
- [x] Marks sidebar visible
- [x] Statistics in footer
