# TextEditor and Layout Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan addresses layout issues, TextEditor improvements, Speaker component redesign, and responsive scaling to maintain component proportions on larger screens.

## Stage 1: Fix Layout Responsive Scaling
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Commit**: `8558795`  
**Objective**: Components maintain proportions on larger screens with increased spacing

### Changes:
- Wrap main content in a max-width container (e.g., 1600px)
- Center the container on larger screens
- Add padding that increases with screen size
- Components maintain fixed max-widths with flexible gaps

### Files:
- `transcription-page.css`
- `page.tsx` (wrapper divs)

### Expected Result:
- Components don't stretch on wide screens
- More whitespace between components on larger displays
- Consistent proportions across screen sizes

### Testing Checklist:
- [x] Components maintain proportions on 1920px+ screens
- [x] Spacing increases on larger screens
- [x] Layout remains centered
- [x] No horizontal scrolling

### Completion Notes:
- Successfully removed max-width constraint
- Gaps increase dramatically on larger screens (up to 70px)
- Header properly aligned with 15px top margin
- Scrollbars completely hidden using multiple techniques
- All components now scale properly with screen size

## IMPORTANT: Process for EVERY Single Stage

### After completing each stage, I will:
1. **STOP** and announce "Stage X Complete - Ready for Testing"
2. **WAIT** for you to test the changes
3. **FIX** any issues you find
4. **GET YOUR APPROVAL** - you must say "approved" or similar
5. **COMMIT TO GIT** with descriptive message
6. **UPDATE git-commits.md** in C:\Users\ayelh\Documents\Projects\Transcription\docs\
7. **UPDATE this implementation-plan.md** with completion status and any notes
8. **ONLY THEN** proceed to next stage

### This happens after EVERY stage, no exceptions!

## Git Commit Format:
```
Stage X: [Brief description]
- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3
```

## Rollback Procedure:
If a stage causes issues:
```bash
# Restore to previous commit
git checkout HEAD~1 -- [affected files]

# Or restore specific stage
git checkout [commit-hash] -- [file-path]
```

This plan ensures incremental progress with testing and version control at each milestone.
