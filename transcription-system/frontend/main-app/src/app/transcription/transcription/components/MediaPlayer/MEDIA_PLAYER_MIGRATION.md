1. **Separated Auto-Detect Modes**: Created separate TSX files for regular and enhanced modes
2. **Regular Mode**: Immediate pause on typing start, resume after delay with rewind-on-pause
3. **Enhanced Mode**: Three-step logic implementation:
   - Step 1: Playing + typing → pause after delay when typing stops
   - Step 2: Paused + typing → resume after delay when typing stops  
   - Step 3: Paused + no typing → auto-resume after configured delay
4. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Centered all settings fields across all tabs
   - Custom spinner controls (+/-) for all number inputs
