### Stage 5: Waveform Integration
- [ ] Generate waveform data
- [ ] Display in progress bar
- [ ] Visual peaks representation
- [ ] Color coding for played/unplayed sections
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Responsive scaling
- [ ] Git commit

## Technical Details

### HTTPS Requirements for Pedal
- WebHID API requires secure context (HTTPS)
- Domain configured: yalitranscription.duckdns.org
- Fallback message for HTTP users
- Auto-redirect implementation for production

### Settings Structure
Each tab maintains exact functionality from original:
1. **Shortcuts Tab**: Complete keyboard mapping with customization
2. **Pedal Tab**: 3-button configuration with visual interface
3. **AutoDetect Tab**: Dual-mode typing detection with timing controls

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Audio playback in all browsers
- [ ] Video playback functionality
- [ ] RTL layout consistency
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts responsiveness
- [ ] Pedal connection over HTTPS
- [ ] Auto-detect accuracy
- [ ] Settings persistence
- [ ] Performance with large media files

## Notes
- Audio mode confirmed working with RTL progress bar ✅
- Keyboard shortcuts fully functional ✅
- Pedal integration complete with all fixes ✅
- Auto-detect typing implementation complete ✅
- Video cube implementation complete ✅
- All features must exactly match original HTML player functionality

## Completed Fixes in Stage 2
1. **React Closure Issues**: Fixed stale state in event handlers by reading from localStorage
2. **Mute/Unmute Toggle**: Now checks actual audio volume instead of React state
3. **Volume Controls**: Increments by 5% with proper initialization
4. **Default Pedal Mapping**: Left=Forward, Right=Backward (swapped from original)

## Stage 3 Complete: Auto-Detect Typing Implementation
1. **Separated Auto-Detect Modes**: Created separate TSX files for regular and enhanced modes
2. **Regular Mode**: Immediate pause on typing start, resume after delay with rewind-on-pause
3. **Enhanced Mode**: Three-step logic implementation:
   - Step 1: Playing + typing → pause after delay when typing stops
   - Step 2: Paused + typing → resume after delay when typing stops  
   - Step 3: Paused + no typing → auto-resume after configured delay
4. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Centered all settings fields across all tabs
   - Custom spinner controls (+/-) for all number inputs
   - Consistent green theme styling matching page design
   - Better Hebrew RTL text alignment
5. **Critical Bug Fixes**:
   - Fixed Numpad 0 not working in settings/timestamp inputs
   - Fixed keyboard shortcuts interfering with text editor typing
   - Resolved useEffect dependency array issues causing crashes
   - Fixed auto-detect scope to only work in text editor areas
   - Fixed pedal auto-reconnect device state conflicts
6. **Code Quality**: Removed debug logging, improved error handling, TypeScript fixes
