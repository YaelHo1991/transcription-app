## Known Issues

### 🔴 Critical
1. **Transcription data mixing between media files** - FIXED in commit 75b1674
2. **Hebrew cursor positioning** - Jumps to wrong position after timestamp
3. **Memory leak in media player** - Occurs with files > 1 hour

### 🟡 Important
1. **Project loader components deleted** - Need reorganization
2. **Waveform rendering slow** - Impacts user experience
3. **No automatic backups** - Data loss risk

### 🟢 Minor
1. **CSS files mixed** - Theme styles embedded in components
2. **Inconsistent file organization** - Some components scattered
3. **Missing ARIA labels** - Accessibility incomplete

## Recent Sessions

### 2025-09-02 - Sub-Agent Design Session
- **Objective**: Design specialized sub-agents for development efficiency
- **Completed**: 
  - Created comprehensive SUB_AGENTS_DESIGN.md
  - Documented 15+ specialized agents
  - Established session documentation system
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Implement session-chronicler agent
  - Set up architecture-surgeon for refactoring

### Previous Sessions
- See `docs/sessions/` folder for detailed session logs

## Architecture Decisions

### Current Issues
- **Problem**: Code organization has become complex
- **Impact**: Refactoring often breaks functionality
- **Solution**: Using architecture-surgeon agent for safe refactoring

### Planned Improvements
1. Consolidate scattered components
2. Extract embedded CSS to theme files
3. Modularize TextEditor component
4. Standardize file naming conventions

## Team Notes

### Development Workflow
1. Use CLAUDE.md for standard procedures
2. Check docs/sessions for previous work
3. Use sub-agents for specialized tasks
4. Document all major changes

### Priority Focus Areas
1. Fix Hebrew text cursor issues
2. Improve media sync accuracy
3. Implement auto-save
4. Organize code architecture

---

## Next Immediate Tasks
1. ⏳ Implement session-chronicler for automatic documentation
2. ⏳ Use hebrew-text-specialist to fix cursor issues
3. ⏳ Set up architecture-surgeon for safe refactoring
4. ⏳ Create backup-guardian for data protection
