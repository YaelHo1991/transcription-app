# Remarks System - Session Summary
## Last Updated: 2025-08-19

## 🎯 Current State

### ✅ What's Complete:
1. **Foundation (Stage 1)**
   - Full types.ts with all 4 remark types
   - RemarksContext with state management
   - Event system for remark creation
   - LocalStorage persistence

2. **Pinned Remarks (Stage 2)**
   - Click ⚑ icon to add new pinned remark
   - Inline editing with auto-focus
   - Enter adds new field, empty blur removes
   - Newest at top sorting
   - 25% max height with scrolling

3. **Partial Features:**
   - Filtering by type (buttons work)
   - Sorting options (time/type/status)
   - Basic Uncertainty remarks display
   - Statistics counter

### ❌ What's NOT Done:
- Stage 3: In-text tags `[` trigger system
- Stage 4: `...` transformation to timestamps
- Stage 5: `//` name tracking
- Stage 6: Long-press media notes
- Stages 7-12: Advanced features

## 🔧 Key Technical Details

### Files Structure:
```
components/Remarks/
├── Remarks.tsx            # Main panel (568 lines)
├── RemarksContext.tsx     # State management
├── RemarkItem.tsx         # Display component
├── types.ts              # TypeScript definitions
├── UncertaintyRemarkContent.tsx
├── ConfirmDialog.tsx
├── Remarks.css
└── docs/
    ├── remarks-implementation-plan.md
    └── remarks-vision.md
```

### Key Functions to Know:
1. **handleAddPinned()** - Adds new pinned remark with focus
2. **addRemark()** - From context, creates new remark
3. **Event system** - Uses `remarkCreate` event for immediate response

### Current Issues/Bugs:
- None known - all TypeScript errors fixed
- Focus works correctly for first pinned remark
- No double confirmation dialogs

## 📝 To Resume Development:

### Next Priority (Stage 3 - In-Text Tags):
1. Add `[` detection in TextBlock.tsx
2. Create dropdown component
3. Implement tag list
4. Add insertion logic

### Quick Start Commands:
```bash
# Start development servers
cd transcription-system/backend && npm run dev
cd transcription-system/frontend/main-app && npm run dev

# Check current state
git log --oneline -5
```

### Key Decisions Made:
1. Used white/monochrome icons instead of colored emojis
2. Pinned remarks use inline editing (not modal)
3. Event-driven for immediate focus response
4. 25% max height for pinned section

---

## 💡 Important Context:

### User Preferences:
- Wants simplicity over complexity
- Prefers inline editing over modals
- Focus should work immediately
- No unnecessary padding/borders

### Testing Notes:
- Test with Hebrew text (RTL)
- Ensure Enter/Escape keys work
- Check localStorage persistence
- Verify focus on first remark

### Git Commits:
- `bbc4dab`: Complete Remarks system implementation
- `fe34518`: Updated documentation with accurate status

## 🚀 Quick Commands to Continue:

```javascript
// To test current state:
// 1. Click ⚑ icon to add pinned remark
// 2. Type text and press Enter for new field
// 3. Leave empty and blur to remove

// To check what's implemented:
grep -r "RemarkType\." --include="*.tsx"
```

## 📌 Session Variables:
- Last working directory: `C:\Users\ayelh\Documents\Projects\Transcription`
- Active branch: master
- Servers running on: backend:5000, frontend:3002
- Theme: Pink/Teal color scheme

---

## Notes for Next Session:
- User wants to focus on other components now
- Remarks system is stable and usable as-is
- Can return to implement remaining stages later
- All progress is saved and documented
