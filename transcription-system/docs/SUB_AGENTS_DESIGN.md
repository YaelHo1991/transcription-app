## Implementation Guide

### How to Create These Agents

1. **Open agent configuration**:
   ```bash
   /agents
   ```

2. **Choose scope**:
   - Project-level: Stored in `.claude/agents/`
   - User-level: Available across all projects

3. **Copy configuration**:
   - Use the YAML configuration from this document
   - Paste into agent creation dialog

4. **Test the agent**:
   - Start with simple task
   - Verify agent understanding
   - Check tool access

### Usage Patterns

**Simple invocation**:
```
"Use [agent-name]: [specific task]"
```

**Detailed invocation**:
```
"Use [agent-name] to analyze [files] and fix [issue] by [approach]"
```

**Multiple agents**:
```
"First use code-archaeologist to map dependencies, then use architecture-surgeon to refactor"
```

### Priority Implementation Order

#### Phase 1: Critical Agents (Immediate)

2. **hebrew-text-specialist** - Fix RTL issues
3. **architecture-surgeon** - Safe refactoring

#### Phase 2: Quality Agents (Week 1)
4. **transcription-validator** - Data integrity
5. **backup-guardian** - Data protection
6. **permission-auditor** - Security

#### Phase 3: Enhancement Agents (Week 2)
7. **media-sync-engineer** - Sync improvements
8. **performance-optimizer** - Speed optimization
9. **theme-coordinator** - UI consistency

#### Phase 4: Advanced Agents (Week 3+)
10. **export-specialist** - Export features
11. **integration-engineer** - External services
12. **migration-specialist** - Database changes

### Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Test agents with simple tasks first
2. **Document usage**: Keep notes on what works
3. **Share context**: Provide relevant file paths
4. **Chain agents**: Use multiple agents for complex tasks
5. **Review output**: Verify agent suggestions before applying

### Troubleshooting

**Agent not understanding task**:
- Be more specific in request
- Provide file paths
- Give example of desired outcome

**Agent lacks permissions**:
