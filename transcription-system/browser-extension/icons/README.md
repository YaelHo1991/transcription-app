## Quick Creation Options:

### Option 1: Online Icon Generators
1. Use Canva, Figma, or similar tools
2. Create 128x128 design first
3. Export smaller sizes with automatic resizing

### Option 2: AI Generation
1. Use AI image generators (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.)
2. Prompt: "Simple cookie icon with download arrow, pink gradient, browser extension style, transparent background"
3. Generate at 128x128 and resize

### Option 3: Professional Design
1. Hire a designer for consistent branding
2. Ensure icons match the transcription system's visual identity

## Current Status:
üîÑ **Icons need to be created** - The extension will work without icons but won't look professional

## Installation:
1. Create the four PNG files following the specifications above
2. Place them in this directory with the exact filenames listed
3. The manifest.json file is already configured to use these icons
